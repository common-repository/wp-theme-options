== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are the settings not affecting my theme?  =

Read the instructions included in the zip.

= Will this work with my theme? =

Because every theme is made differently. There is no way to predict the classes and ID's used for your particular theme. Instructions are included how to set the options to work for your specific theme.

= The style changer only changes the background color =

By default, this is all I've added to the style switcher css. It's up to you to add your own custom style and color changes.You can change pretty much any aspect of your theme with a bit of effort.
